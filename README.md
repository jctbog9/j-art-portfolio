# README

This application is currently under development. It will feature admin functionality run through Devise gem authentication and will run on Ruby version 2.4.5 and React version 14.5.2

This application is a portfolio for an artist to be able to login and manage their inventory.

Each image they are listing for sale on the site will be housed within whichever exhibition it has been shown at.

This application does not yet support payment but will eventually use PayPal-Ruby-SDK or something similar to process and manage transactions.
